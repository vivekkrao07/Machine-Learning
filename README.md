This project is an AI-powered Exercise Tracker that uses a webcam and MediaPipe to count squats and bicep curls in real time. It logs reps, calculates calories burned, generates a PDF summary, and emails the report automatically. A simple Tkinter GUI collects user details and launches the full workout tracking system.
